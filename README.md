### RJxKenshin
Minecraft modder & lead creator at @Nostalgica-Reverie

### Minecraft Modding
I am a modpack/resource pack developer with over 1 million downloads across my personal projects, like Re-Console.

I manage the organization Nostalgica Reverie, which has 2.8 million downloads across Modrinth and Curseforge. Nostalgica's mods provide necessities for people looking to recreate the old in the new, like Nostalgic Tweaks and Moderner Beta.

I've been playing video games for over 11 years.
I am a musician, and regularly go to the gym ðŸ’ª I currently play drums and keys, and have been on my fitness journey since August of 2024!!

I collect vinyls (20 vinyls), and Video Game Consoles (PS3, PS4, PS5, Wii, Wii U, Xbox One X, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch)

### Contact
