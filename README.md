# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @omo50, aka omoso or bowen
FOSS enjoyer, GD player, modpack developer with 300k+ downloads. You most likely know me from Re-Console, the most successful LCE modpack on Modrinth.

## ‚ùì Who are you, what have you made?
I'm most involved in the Minecraft modding scene. My most notable project is Re-Console, which is the most successful modpack of its kind, alongside being the 7th most followed project on Modrinth!

I am also involved in Vital, originally by Devin, which is a fabric modpack alternative to the Essential Mod. I am involved in some way in over 20 projects, with more modpacks on the way soon!

I am also involved in the Globed mod for Geometry Dash, which adds multiplayer into the game. I am currently a moderator there. My hardest is currently Poltergeist (2844 attempts).

## üéπ What do you like to do?
Outside of playing video games, I like playing music, as a Cellist and an amateur Keyboardist! I like to write music, collect vinyls and gaming consoles, alongside collecting coins. I absolutely love history and politics as well, having self studied history for over 4 years, and politics for 3.

I also listen to a lot of music. My current favorite artists are bo en, Drive45, Tyler, The Creator and Kendrick Lamar.

## Where can I find you?
Discord, Modrinth and nowhere else. I stay off of other social media such as Twitter or Bluesky (for now).
My Discord is @omo50, check me out on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/bowen). You can support my work on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/omoso).
