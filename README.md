# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @omo50, aka omoso
FOSS enjoyer, modpack developer with 85k+ downloads. You most likely know me from Re-Console, the most successful LCE modpack on Modrinth.

I am an aspiring Geometry Dash player and creator. I generally spend time in the Globed community specifically.

At this current moment, I am not extraordinarily active in the Minecraft community.

## Where can i find you?
Discord, Modrinth and nowhere else.
My Discord is @omo50, check me out on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/omoso). Support my work on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/omoso)
