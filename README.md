# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @omo50, aka omoso
FOSS enjoyer, modpack developer with 80k+ downloads. You most likely know me from Re-Console, the most successful LCE modpack on Modrinth.

I am an aspiring Geometry Dash player and creator. I generally spend time in the Globed community specifically.

At this current moment, I am not extraordinarily active in the Minecraft community.
